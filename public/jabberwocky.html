		'Twas <em>brillig</em>, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gymble in the wabe:
All <em>mimsy</em> were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

		<p class="second-verse">
			"<span>Beware the Jabberwock</span>, my son!
			The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
			Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
			The frumious Bandersnatch!"
		</p>

		He took his vorpal sword in hand;
Long time the manxome foe he sought&mdash;
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought.
